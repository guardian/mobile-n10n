This document summarises our benefit analysis of push notification.

## Potential benefit 1: Readers get to know the breaking news sooner

This benefit can largely be captured by the metric of the percentage of notifications sent within 2 minutes

## Potential benefit 2: Readers read the stories once they receive the notification

If readers receive the notification from the Guardian earlier (than from other news services), they are more likely to click through and read the stories, which leads to higher number of page views referred by `App Alert`.

Here are some consideration around this kind of metric:

1. Some stories are more interesting than others.  Readers may not click through just because they find it not interesting.

2. Topics have different number of receipients. For example, notifications sent to `breaking/uk` have much more receipients than those sent to `breaking/international`.  Some notifications are sent to multiple topics.

We may consider using the following metrics, but all of them are affected to different degrees by the factors above :

1. Page view referred by `App Alert`

2. Percentage of Page view referred by `App Alert`

3. Percentage of Page view `App Alert` against the total number of recipients

## Potential benefit 3: Readers spend more time reading through the stories if they receive the notification

Maybe readers tend to fully read a story if it is a breaking news? 

We may get the attention time of the page view from `App Alert`

## Potential benefit 4: it may drive up the total page view?

It appears that the page view referred by App Alert may not have significant impact on the total page view.  For example, on 30-Sep-2022, there were a total of 47 million page views, among which only 0.25 millions were from App Alert (around 0.5%).
